Opensource privacy orientated outbreak monitoring and alert apps and tools

## User journey

Alice downloads the pandemic app for iOS. Creates a profile, links her profile to facebook, linkedin and keybase. 
She can invite other users, and gives the app background location permissions.

The app keeps track of her location and other people who come close to her. 

John, one of Alice's co-workers has done the same. Sadly, he starts feeling ill. 
He talks to his doctor, and as he is considered high risk, does a test that comes out positive.
On the app, he registers that he has taken a test and it was positive.

All the users who have interacted with John, or someone who has interacted with John (in his graph), 
get's a notification, with instructions/recommendations depending on the specific risk factors. 

Alice recieves a message that she should self quarantine and if posible take a test.

Sara is an epidemologist. She is using an app that can model population risk scenarios in realtime
based on anonymous data provided by the app. Hopefully policy makers can make better decisions.
But noone can reverse engineer the data to find out who or where John is. 

## The challenge

Anonymity discovery, balancing public usefulness with privacy. Obviously max usefulness is having a record of every interaction between people, and have access to the full graph, including name and address so that you extract them and isolate them immediately in underwater detention and re-education centers.

That's why I believe that an application like this has to be: anonymous, decentralized, opensource, and keep the data from leaving the phone in the first place. 

## Next steps

After collecting some feedback, I'd like to do a public call for ideas/help. I believe a project of this type can only be possible if it is community driven and in deep collaboration with all stackholders.
